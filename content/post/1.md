# How to name the files of the posts?

I found a nice way to name the files of the posts for the blog.

This is not the title of the post, the title is a field in the Markdown file.

Initially I was using some sort of shortened title for the file name.

I came across the blog post [Write Code Like You Just Learned How to Program](https://prog21.dadgum.com/87.html).

I don't think the post got to me, but I found the answer to my problem for the post file names.

The blog names the files with number. Just a number.

This will solve the problem with of choosing a file name. It will solve also the problem of sorting and searching for the files.

I will use a number for the file name of the post. This post is 1. Next will be 2. And so on.
