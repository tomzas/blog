On Mac Docker for Desktop was the easy way to run development containers. With the license change,
it's no longer free for commercial use.

There is a good alternative:

Rancher Desktop.

By default Rancher Desktop is using the container runtime `containerd`, with which it recommends to
use nerdctl. The nerdctl doesn't support MacOS. The way Rancher makes it work is that it runs the nerdctl
inside the VM that it spins up and command line tool is a wrapper script.

VS Code on the other hand is using docker containers for devcontainers.

Fortunately, Rancher Desktop allows to change the container runtime to docker (project mody) and it's
possible to use docker-cli as before.

The VS Code devcontainers work as well.
